# Plant Disease Classfication

The system is designed to identify diseases in various plants through an end-to-end process. It accepts images of plant leaves as input, either uploaded or captured in real-time using the device's camera. The system then classifies the leaf based on potential diseases it may have. It can identify 15 different classes across three types of plants: potato, tomato, and bell pepper. Additionally, the system provides a confidence score for each prediction, indicating the likelihood of each diagnosis.
